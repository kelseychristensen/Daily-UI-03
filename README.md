## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- 
### What went into this project

This turned into a challenge within a challenge. Because I wanted to use mockups in my design for this fictional app website, I had to design the UI of those too (although I focused way less on that UI than the site UI).

I made the mockups in Canva and gave them a transparent background in GIMP before moving them into my IDE project. Then, I used pure CSS to position them before styling the rest of the website.

### What I learned

I learned a lot about absolute positioning, hiding overflows, and transforms in this challenge: it felt like cheating to make an image of the mockups to use as a background, so they are all placed there. That being said, this site would need a LOT of retooling to be responsive.

I worked 

### Continued development

I would love to learn more about how developers that create really glossy, modern websites (with things like mockups going every which way) that are responsive! I imagine it takes a lot of work to make a design look good as people not only change media, but just their window width and height! I really  want to learn more about what goes into a process like that.

    transform: rotate(-20deg);
    position: absolute;
